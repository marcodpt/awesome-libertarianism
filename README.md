## Personal reviews

### [Economic Policy, Thoughts for Today and Tomorrow](https://mises.org/library/economic-policy-thoughts-today-and-tomorrow)
[Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises), 1979

An introductory book suitable for anyone interested in free market economics.
Very accessible, it is a good starting point for the Austrian School of
Economics.

### [The Law](https://mises.org/library/law)
[Frédéric Bastiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Bastiat), 1849

An introductory book and critique of regulation and the use of legislation by
authorities. Your criticism is very current even for a book written more than
150 years ago. It is especially good for lawyers and people interested in
legislation from a libertarian perspective.

### [The Anatomy of the State](https://mises.org/library/anatomy-state)
[Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard), 1974

This is a simple and excellent book for deconstructing the aura of the state
and starting to think objectively about your need. A good starting point for
anarcho-capitalist ideas.

### [What Has Government Done to Our Money?](https://mises.org/library/what-has-government-done-our-money)
[Murray Rothbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard), 1963

An easy-to-read book that discusses the role of money in society, the banking
system with its regulatory aspects, and the implications of Keynesian economics
in society.

### [The origin of money](https://mises.org/library/origins-money-0)
[Carl Menger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Menger), 1892

This book is a discussion of something we hardly ever ask about its origins.
Money. It is a simple and objective approach. Very useful to understand the
origins of the gold standard.

### [The Production of Security](https://mises.org/library/production-security-0)
[Gustave de Molinari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_de_Molinari), 1849

This book is a pioneering case for security as a private service. It was
written about a hundred years before the beginning of the development of
anarcho-capitalism.

### [No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority](https://mises.org/library/no-treason-constitution-no-authority-audio)
[Lysander Spooner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner), 1867

This book aims to analyze how the American Constitution is enforced against
the will of American citizens. And how this goes against people's rights,
attacking the concept of the social contract.

### [Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth](https://mises.org/library/economic-calculation-socialist-commonwealth)
[Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises), 1920

The original paper that introduced the economic calculation problem argument in
socialist economics. Very important from a historical and theoretical point of
view.

### [Atlas Shrugged](https://www.amazon.com/Atlas-Shrugged-Ayn-Rand/dp/0451191145)
[Ayn Rand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand), 1957

Perhaps the most popular and influential book on the defense of liberty. This
tale is a classic that hit the mainstream, the plot takes you back to the
present day, when regulation and the state are stifling society and taking away
the incentive to produce. The author uses the dialogues between the characters
to introduce ideas favorable to the free market and the moral defense of
liberty.
